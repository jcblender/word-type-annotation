# POS Tagging, Smoothing and Unknown Words

## Introduce
A POS tagging project uses HMM and Viterbi written in Python by 190000096. This project investigates whether the use of Witten-Bell Smoothing and UNK tags will improve the tagging accuracy in English and other languages. 

## Content
This project includes three .py files:
1.smooth.py : This smoothing program investigates whether the use of Witten-Bell Smoothing will improve the accuracy.
2.tagging.py: This tagging program investigates whether the use of UNK tags will improve the accuracy in English. It may takes about half an hour to output.
3.tagging_for_portuguese.py : This tagging program investigates whether the use of UNK tags will improve the accuracy in Portuguese language.
